# Marketing-Operations-Analysis

Presenting key insights from our guest experience feedback, gathered both at check-in and check-out. The goal is to understand what we’re doing well, where expectations are falling short, and how we can refine both service and marketing to elevate overall satisfaction.

Let’s begin-

Guests consistently appreciated three standout features: the quiet and restful environment, our delicious breakfast, and fast, reliable Wi-Fi. These were not only top reasons why people booked with us but also remained strong points of praise after their stay.

In fact, 89% of those who expected a quiet stay reported being satisfied — that’s a great sign of consistency. Our breakfast was another pleasant surprise, often exceeding expectations. And Wi-Fi, often a dealbreaker for remote workers — delivered exactly what was promised. These features form the core of our competitive advantage, and they’re clearly being noticed.

But not all expectations were met. When we look at check-out data, we see noticeable drop-offs in mentions of clean and comfortable rooms, staff friendliness, and fitness facilities. These are areas where guests came in with high hopes, but left underwhelmed. 

For example, comfortable rooms were frequently cited during check-in but saw a sharp decline at check-out, pointing to inconsistency in upkeep or service. Similarly, friendly staff, a hallmark of hospitality saw a lower mention post-stay, suggesting we may need to strengthen consistency and personal interaction.

With that in mind, here are four actionable recommendations:

First, let’s improve the check-in experience. While it didn’t draw strong negative feedback, it also didn’t have expectations from the guests. A smooth, welcoming arrival enhanced by signage, digital check-in, or concierge touches can create a stronger first impression.

Second, we need to focus on room quality and service responsiveness. Standardizing cleaning procedures and empowering staff to handle special requests quickly and warmly will help bridge the expectation gap.

Third, we must elevate our amenities. The gym, family-friendly offerings, and interior design features are either underutilized or not being promoted effectively. Small and simple things like pre-arrival emails can make a big difference.

Lastly, on the marketing front, we should double down on what guests already love breakfast, Wi-Fi, and quiet surroundings while also repositioning underappreciated features like ease of parking and interior design through refreshed visuals and guest testimonials.

In summary, we are already delivering on our key promises — now we focus on fine-tuning the rest of the experiences by marketing our strengths rightly to get ahead.
